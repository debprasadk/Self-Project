# Multi-Label Image Classification
I took data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hbku2019/data?select=imgs.zip which is for Multi-Label Image Classification. I use shallow model here. For lack of memory I take only 10000 data points from 97774 datapoints as train set from which 20% are kept for validation.
